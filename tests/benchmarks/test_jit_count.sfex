# Test to count JIT vs interpreter executions

Concept: Math
    To Double with X:
        Return X + X

Story:
    Print "Calling Double 120 times to see JIT pattern..."
    Print ""

    Create Math Called M

    Result is 0
    Repeat 120 times:
        Result is M.Double with 5

    Print "Final result: " + Result
    Print ""
    Print "Expected: JIT compiles at call #100, then executes JIT for calls 100-120"
