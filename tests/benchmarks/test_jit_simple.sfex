# Simple JIT test - method that returns arithmetic result

Concept: Math
    To Double with X:
        Return X + X

Story:
    Print "Testing JIT with simple arithmetic..."
    Print ""

    Create Math Called Obj

    # Call 150 times to trigger JIT
    Print "Calling Double 150 times..."

    StartTime is Time.Precise()

    Result is 0
    Repeat 150 times:
        Result is Obj.Double with 5

    EndTime is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed is EndTime - StartTime

    Print "Final result: " + Result
    Print "Time: " + Elapsed + " seconds"
    Print ""
    Print "Expected: JIT compilation at call ~100, then fast native execution"
