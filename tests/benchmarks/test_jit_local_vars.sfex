# Test local variables in JIT

Concept: Math
    To SimpleAssign:
        X is 42
        Return X

    To TwoVars:
        A is 10
        B is 20
        Return A + B

    To UpdateVar:
        X is 5
        X is X + 10
        Return X

Story:
    Print "=== JIT LOCAL VARIABLES TEST ==="
    Print ""

    Create Math Called M

    Print "1. Simple assignment..."
    Result is 0
    Repeat 120 times:
        Result is M.SimpleAssign

    Print "SimpleAssign: " + Result + " (expected: 42)"
    Print ""

    Print "2. Two variables..."
    Result2 is 0
    Repeat 120 times:
        Result2 is M.TwoVars

    Print "TwoVars: " + Result2 + " (expected: 30)"
    Print ""

    Print "3. Update variable..."
    Result3 is 0
    Repeat 120 times:
        Result3 is M.UpdateVar

    Print "UpdateVar: " + Result3 + " (expected: 15)"
