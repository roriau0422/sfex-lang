# JIT Test - Simple method called many times to trigger JIT compilation

Concept: Calculator
    Value

    To Add with Number:
        Return This.Value + Number

Story:
    Print "Testing JIT Compilation..."
    Print ""

    # Create calculator
    Create Calculator Called Calc
    Set Calc.Value to 5

    # Call method 150 times (threshold is 100)
    # Should trigger JIT compilation around call #100
    Print "Calling Add method 150 times..."

    StartTime is Time.Precise()

    Result is 0
    Repeat 150 times:
        Result is Calc.Add with 10

    EndTime is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed is EndTime - StartTime

    Print "Final result: " + Result
    Print "Time elapsed: " + Elapsed + " seconds"
    Print ""
    Print "JIT should have been triggered at call #100"
    Print "(Check for 'JIT compilation' messages if compilation occurred)"
