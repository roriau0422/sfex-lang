# Million call benchmark to see true JIT speedup

Concept: Math
    To Double with X:
        Return X + X

Story:
    Print "=== JIT 1 MILLION CALL BENCHMARK ==="
    Print ""

    Create Math Called M

    Print "Calling Double 1,000,000 times..."
    StartTime is Time.Precise()

    Result is 0
    Repeat 1000000 times:
        Result is M.Double with 5

    EndTime is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed is EndTime - StartTime

    Print "Done. Result: " + Result
    Print "Time: " + Elapsed + " seconds"
    Print "Throughput: " + (1000000 / Elapsed) + " calls/sec"
    Print ""
    Print "(99.99% of calls use JIT - should show true JIT performance)"
