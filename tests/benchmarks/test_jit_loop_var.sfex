# Test loop with local variable

Concept: Math
    To CountToFive:
        Total is 0
        Repeat 5 times:
            Total is Total + 1
        Return Total

Story:
    Print "=== JIT LOOP WITH LOCAL VARIABLE ==="
    Print ""

    Create Math Called M

    # Warm up - interpreter
    Print "Interpreter result: " + M.CountToFive
    Print ""

    # Trigger JIT
    Print "Calling 120 times to trigger JIT..."
    Result is 0
    Repeat 120 times:
        Result is M.CountToFive

    Print "After JIT: " + Result + " (expected: 5)"
