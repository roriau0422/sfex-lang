    X, Y, VX, VY, Mass, ForceX, ForceY

    To UpdatePhysics with DeltaTime:
        AccelX is This.ForceX / This.Mass
        AccelY is This.ForceY / This.Mass
        Set This.VX to This.VX + AccelX * DeltaTime
        Set This.VY to This.VY + AccelY * DeltaTime
        Set This.X to This.X + This.VX * DeltaTime
        Set This.Y to This.Y + This.VY * DeltaTime
        Return This.X
