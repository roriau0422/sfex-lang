# Test JIT compilation of control flow (If/Else and Repeat)

Concept: Logic
    To Max with A and B:
        If A > B:
            Return A
        Else:
            Return B

    To IsPositive with X:
        If X > 0:
            Return 1
        Else:
            Return 0

    To Factorial with N:
        Result is 1
        Counter is 1
        Repeat N times:
            Result is Result * Counter
            Counter is Counter + 1
        Return Result

    To Sum with N:
        Total is 0
        Repeat N times:
            Total is Total + 1
        Return Total
