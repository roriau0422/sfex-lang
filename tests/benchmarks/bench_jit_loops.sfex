# Benchmark loops with local variables in JIT

Concept: Math
    To SumToN with N:
        Total is 0
        Repeat N times:
            Total is Total + 1
        Return Total

    To Factorial with N:
        Result is 1
        Counter is 1
        Repeat N times:
            Result is Result * Counter
            Counter is Counter + 1
        Return Result

Story:
    Print "=== JIT LOOP PERFORMANCE ==="
    Print ""

    Create Math Called M

    Print "1. SumToN (1M calls with N=10)..."
    StartTime is Time.Precise()

    Result is 0
    Repeat 1000000 times:
        Result is M.SumToN with 10

    EndTime is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed is EndTime - StartTime

    Print "Result: " + Result
    Print "Time: " + Elapsed + " seconds"
    Print "Throughput: " + (1000000 / Elapsed) + " calls/sec"
    Print ""

    Print "2. Factorial (100K calls with N=10)..."
    StartTime2 is Time.Precise()

    Result2 is 0
    Repeat 100000 times:
        Result2 is M.Factorial with 10

    EndTime2 is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed2 is EndTime2 - StartTime2

    Print "Result: " + Result2 + " (10! = 3628800)"
    Print "Time: " + Elapsed2 + " seconds"
    Print "Throughput: " + (100000 / Elapsed2) + " calls/sec"
    Print ""

    Print "Loops with local variables in JIT! 🚀"
