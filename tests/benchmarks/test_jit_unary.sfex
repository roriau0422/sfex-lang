# Test JIT compilation of unary operators

Concept: Math
    To Negate with X:
        Return -X

    To IsZero with X:
        Return not X

Story:
    Print "=== JIT UNARY OPERATORS TEST ==="
    Print ""

    Create Math Called M

    Print "Testing Negate (120 calls to trigger JIT)..."
    Result is 0
    Repeat 120 times:
        Result is M.Negate with 42

    Print "Negate(42): " + Result + " (expected: -42)"
    Print ""

    Print "Testing Not/IsZero (120 calls to trigger JIT)..."
    Result1 is 0
    Repeat 120 times:
        Result1 is M.IsZero with 0

    Print "IsZero(0): " + Result1 + " (expected: 1 for true)"

    Result2 is 0
    Repeat 120 times:
        Result2 is M.IsZero with 5

    Print "IsZero(5): " + Result2 + " (expected: 0 for false)"
    Print ""
    Print "All unary operator tests complete!"
