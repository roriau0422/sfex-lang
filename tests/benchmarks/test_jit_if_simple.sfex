# Simple If/Else test without local variables

Concept: Math
    To Abs with X:
        If X < 0:
            Return -X
        Else:
            Return X

    To Sign with X:
        If X > 0:
            Return 1
        If X < 0:
            Return -1
        Return 0

    To Clamp with X:
        If X > 100:
            Return 100
        If X < 0:
            Return 0
        Return X

    Create Math Called M

    EndTime is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed is EndTime - StartTime

    Print "Result: " + Result + " (expected: 42)"

    Print "Throughput: " + (1000000 / Elapsed) + " calls/sec"

    Result2 is 0
    Repeat 1000000 times:

    EndTime2 is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed2 is EndTime2 - StartTime2

    Print "If/Else in JIT is working! 🎉"
