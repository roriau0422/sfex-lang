# Debug loop variable behavior

Concept: Counter
    To Count with N:
        Total is 0
        Repeat N times:
            Total is Total + 1
        Return Total

    To DoubleLoop with N:
        A is 0
        B is 0
        Repeat N times:
            A is A + 1
            B is B + 2
        Return A + B

Story:
    Print "=== LOOP VARIABLE DEBUG ==="
    Print ""

    Create Counter Called C

    # Single call - interpreter
    Print "Interpreter - Count(5): " + C.Count with 5
    Print "Interpreter - Count(10): " + C.Count with 10
    Print ""

    # Force JIT compilation
    Print "Triggering JIT compilation (120 calls)..."
    Dummy is 0
    Repeat 120 times:
        Dummy is C.Count with 3

    Print "After JIT - Count(3): " + Dummy
    Print ""

    # Test with different values
    Print "JIT - Count(5): " + C.Count with 5
    Print "JIT - Count(10): " + C.Count with 10
    Print ""

    # Double loop test
    Print "Interpreter - DoubleLoop(5): " + C.DoubleLoop with 5
