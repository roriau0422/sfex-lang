# Pure function benchmark - no field access needed

Concept: Math
    To Double with X:
        Return X + X

    To Triple with X:
        Return X + X + X

Story:
    Print "=== JIT PURE FUNCTION BENCHMARK ==="

    Create Math Called M

    Print "1. Testing Double (100,000 calls)..."
    StartTime is Time.Precise()

    Result is 0
    Repeat 100000 times:
        Result is M.Double with 5

    EndTime is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed is EndTime - StartTime

    Print "Done. Result: " + Result
    Print "Time: " + Elapsed + " seconds"
    Print ""

    Print "2. Testing Triple (100,000 calls)..."
    StartTime2 is Time.Precise()

    Result2 is 0
    Repeat 100000 times:
        Result2 is M.Triple with 3

    EndTime2 is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed2 is EndTime2 - StartTime2

    Print "Done. Result: " + Result2

    Print "Expected: ~5-10x speedup after JIT kicks in at call #100"
