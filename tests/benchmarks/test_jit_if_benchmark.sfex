# Benchmark If/Else performance in JIT

Concept: Math
    To Abs with X:
        If X < 0:
            Return -X
        Else:
            Return X

    To Max3 with A and B and C:
        If A > B:
            If A > C:
                Return A
            Else:
                Return C
        Else:
            If B > C:
                Return B
            Else:
                Return C

    EndTime2 is Time.Precise()
    Elapsed2 is EndTime2 - StartTime2
