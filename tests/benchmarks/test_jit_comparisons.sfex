# Test JIT compilation of comparison operators

Concept: Comparator
    To IsEqual with A and B:
        Return A = B

    To IsGreater with A and B:
        Return A > B

    To IsLess with A and B:
        Return A < B

    To IsGreaterEq with A and B:
        Return A >= B

    To IsLessEq with A and B:
        Return A <= B

    To IsNotEqual with A and B:
        Return A != B
