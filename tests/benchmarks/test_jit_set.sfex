Story:
    Print "Testing JIT with Set statements (field mutation)..."
    Print ""

    Create Counter Called C
    Set C.Value to 0

    Print "Incrementing counter 200 times (should trigger JIT at ~100)..."
    Repeat 200 times:
        Temp is C.Increment

    Print "Final count: "
    Print C.Value
    Print ""

    Print "If you saw '🔥 JIT: Compiling...' above, Set statements work in JIT!"
    Print "If not, the method fell back to interpreter (Set not yet optimized)"

Concept: Counter
    Value

    To Increment:
        Set This.Value to This.Value + 1
        Return This.Value
