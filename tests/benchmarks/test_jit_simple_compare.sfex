# Simple comparison test

Concept: Math
    To IsGreater with A and B:
        Return A > B

Story:
    Print "Testing IsGreater..."

    Create Math Called M

    # First 10 calls - interpreter
    Print "First call (interpreter): " + M.IsGreater with 20 and 10

    # Call 100 more times to trigger JIT
    Result is 0
    Repeat 110 times:
        Result is M.IsGreater with 20 and 10

    Print "After JIT: " + Result + " (expected: 1)"
