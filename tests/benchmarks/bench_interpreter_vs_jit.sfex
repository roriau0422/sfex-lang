Concept: Counter
    Value

    To SlowAdd:
        # This method stays in interpreter (< 100 calls)
        Set This.Value to This.Value + 1
        Return This.Value

    To FastAdd:
        # This method gets JIT compiled (>= 100 calls)
        # Same operation as SlowAdd
        Set This.Value to This.Value + 1
        Return This.Value
