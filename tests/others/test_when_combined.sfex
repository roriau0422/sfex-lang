    # 1. REACTIVE OBSERVER (Concept Level)
    # This runs automatically when Score changes
    When Score changes:
        Print ">> Observer: Score changed to " + This.Score
        
        # 2. PATTERN MATCHING (Statement Level)
        # This logic is nested inside the observer!
        When This.Score:
            is 100:
                Set This.Grade to "A+"
            is 90:
                Set This.Grade to "A"
            Otherwise:
                Set This.Grade to "B"
