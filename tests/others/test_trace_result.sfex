Story:
    Create MathOps Called M
    Set M.X to 5.5
    Set M.Y to 3.3

    Result is M.ComplexCalc
    Print "Result: " + Result

    AddSq is M.AddSquares
    Print "AddSquares: " + AddSq

    X is M.GetX
    Print "GetX: " + X

Concept: MathOps
    X
    Y

    To AddSquares:
        A is This.X * This.X
        B is This.Y * This.Y
        Sum is A + B
        Return Sum

    To GetX:
        Return This.X

    To ComplexCalc:
        Sum is This.AddSquares
        X is This.GetX
        Result is Sum + X
        Return Result
