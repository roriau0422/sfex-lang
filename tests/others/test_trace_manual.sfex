    Create Calculator Called C
    Set C.A to 10.0
    Set C.B to 5.0
    Set C.C to 3.0
    Set C.D to 2.0

    R1 is C.Step1
    Print "Step1: " + R1

    R2 is C.Step2
    Print "Step2: " + R2

    R3 is C.Step3
    Print "Step3: " + R3

    R4 is C.Step4
    Print "Step4: " + R4

    R5 is C.Step5
    Print "Step5: " + R5

    Total is R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5
    Print "Total: " + Total

    D

    To Step1:
        Sum is This.A + This.B
        Product is This.A * This.B
        Result is Sum + Product
        Return Result

    To Step2:
        Diff is This.A - This.B
        Quot is This.A / This.B
        Result is Diff + Quot
        Return Result

    To Step3:
        Temp1 is This.C * This.C
        Temp2 is This.D * This.D
        Temp3 is Temp1 + Temp2
        Result is Temp3 * This.A
        Return Result

    To Step4:
        X is This.B + This.C
        Y is X * This.D
        Z is Y - This.A
        Final is Z + This.B
        Return Final

    To Step5:
        V1 is This.A / This.D
        V2 is This.B * This.C
        V3 is V1 + V2
        V4 is V3 - This.C
        V5 is V4 + This.D
        Return V5
